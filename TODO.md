# Project Tasks

### Task 1: Fix CI Coverage Failure

The CI workflow is failing on the coverage step because the test coverage is below the 90% threshold. 

- **Option A:** Increase test coverage to > 90% by writing more tests for `app.py`.
- **Option B:** Justify why 90% is not achievable and propose a lower, more reasonable threshold.

### Task 2: Set up Continuous Deployment (CD)

With CI in place, the next step is to set up a CD pipeline.

- Propose a plan to automatically deploy the application to Google Cloud Run when changes are merged to the `main` branch.
- Implement the approved plan.

### Task 3: Reflect on Mistakes and Improve Strategy

Review the entire process of setting up this project, identify all mistakes made, and analyze the root cause of the flawed thinking, planning, and problem-solving strategies.

- Is there a fundamental flaw in the agent's logic or design?
- Is the agent's behavior customizable with a properly written `GEMINI.md` file?
- Propose a concrete plan to avoid these mistakes and wasted work in the future.
